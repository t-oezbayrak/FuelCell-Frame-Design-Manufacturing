# Design & Manufacturing of Frame for Hydrogen Fuel Cell System

## Overview

This project focuses on the design and in-house manufacturing of a compact structural frame for a hydrogen fuel cell system and its supporting electronics.

The objective was to achieve:
- Compact integration within vehicle constraints
- Structural stability under operational loads
- Serviceability and modular access
- Minimal weight penalty

The final system passed all technical inspections and contributed to securing 2nd place at Shell Eco-Marathon Europe 2025.

## Engineering Scope

- Layout optimization of fuel cell stack, H₂ bottle, PCBs, and balance-of-plant components
- Structural frame design for mounting and load transfer
- Custom brackets and modular supports for subsystems
- Design for Manufacturing (DfM) implementation
- In-house fabrication and assembly
- System integration and pre-race validation

---

## Engineering Considerations

- Packaging under strict volume constraints
- Vibration and load transfer management
- Cooling and airflow access for electronics
- Wiring accessibility and maintenance clearance
- Safety compliance for hydrogen components
